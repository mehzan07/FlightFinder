Upload Your Files
Log in to PythonAnywhere and click the Files tab.

Go into the folder.mysite/

Upload: .app.py

Templates: Create a new folder named inside . Enter it and upload and .templatesmysite/index.htmlredirect.html

2. Set Up the Virtual Environment
This keeps your project's libraries (like Flask) organized.

Go to the Consoles tab and open a Bash console.

Run these commands (wait for the first to finish before typing the second):

Bash

mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.10 flight-env
pip install flask requests
3. Connect the Web App
Go to the Web tab.

Click "Add a new web app" (choose "Manual Configuration" and "Python 3.10").

Virtualenv section: Enter in the box. It will automatically find the path.flight-env

WSGI Section: Click the link for the "WSGI configuration file." Delete the example code and paste this:

Python

import sys
import os

path = '/home/mehzan07/mysite'
if path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, path)

from app import app as application
Save and hit the green Reload button on the Web tab.

4. Connect to WordPress
Go to your WordPress Dashboard > Appearance > Menus.

Add a Custom Link.

URL: https://mehzan07.pythonanywhere.com

Link Text: "Find Cheap Flights"

One Important Note on the "Whitelist"
PythonAnywhere free accounts only allow outgoing internet connections to specific "whitelisted" sites. If your search fails, it's likely because Travelpayouts isn't on the list yet.

Check the list: PythonAnywhere Whitelist

Request an addition: If isn't there, send a quick message to with a link to the travelpayouts.comsupport@pythonanywhere.comTravelpayouts API documentation. They are usually very helpful!

When you're ready to do this, would you like me to double-check your app.py code to make sure the redirect to flights.softsolutionsahand.com is 100% correct?











Deploying a Flask Flight Search App to PythonAnywhereAuthor: Gemini AI Thought Partner | Date: January 2, 
20261. Environment Setup (The "Box")Always use a Virtual Environment to keep your libraries organized.Open a
 Bash Console.Create your environment (if not already done): mkvirtualenv flight-env --python=python3.10Crucial: 
 Ensure your console prompt starts with .(flight-env)2. Installing Required LibrariesRun this "Master Command" 
 in your Bash console to install every dependency your app requires:Bashpip install flask flask-sqlalchemy 
 flask-migrate amadeus requests dateparser word2number spacy python-dotenv psycopg2-binary flask-cors
Special Step for NLP:If your app uses spaCy for city/date recognition, you must download the language 
model:Bashpython -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
3. Mandatory File ChecklistEnsure these files are uploaded to via the Files tab:/home/mehzan07/app.py 
(Main entry point)database.py (Database configuration)flight_search.py & amadeus_search.py (API logic)utils.py (Helper functions).env (Contains your API Keys: , etc.)AMADEUS_KEYFolder: (Must contain your files)templates/.html4. Web Tab ConfigurationGo to the Web tab and verify these settings:Source Code: /home/mehzan07/Virtualenv: Click and enter (It should resolve to flight-env/home/mehzan07/.virtualenvs/flight-env)Force HTTPS: Set to Enabled.Static Files: If you have CSS/JS, map to ./static//home/mehzan07/static/5. Troubleshooting: The "Error Loop"When you see "Something went wrong," do not guess. Follow the Log Trail:Step A: Find the LogGo to the Web Tab.Click the link ending in error.log.Scroll to the very bottom.Step B: Identify the Error TypeError MessageMeaningFixModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'X'A library is missing.pip install X in Bash console.ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'database'A local file is missing.Upload the missing .py file.OperationalError / Connection TimeoutDatabase connection failed.Check your .env database URL.KeyError: 'AMADEUS_API_KEY'API Key is missing.Add the key to your .env file or Environment Variables.6.
