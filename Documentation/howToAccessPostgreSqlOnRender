Connect to your database
Every Render Postgres database has two different URLs for incoming connections:

An internal URL for connections from your other Render services hosted in the same region
An external URL for connections from everything else Render

Use the internal URL wherever possible. It minimizes query latency by enabling communication over your private network.

Both URLs are available from the Connect menu in the top-right corner of your database's page in the Render Dashboard:
  

How to access to postgresql database on Render. from your local machine:
1- go to render dashboard () and click on the database server under Connection you can find all info about your database
2- copy external url (it look likes: - The external database URL from Render (looks like postgres://username:password@hostname:port/dbname)

Option 1: Using pgAdmin
- Open pgAdmin and create a new server.
- Under the Connection tab, fill in:
- Host name/address: the part after @ and before the slash in your external URL (e.g., your-db-host.render.com)
- Port: usually 5432
- Maintenance database: your database name
- Username: from the URL
- Password: from the URL (you’ll be prompted)
- Save and connect.

ption 2: Using psql from Terminal
psql "postgres://username:password@hostname:5432/dbname"
username, password; hostname; and dbname you can find from the Render under connection

or copy your external url from render

1- in your local machine open command prompt
4- run this : > psql "your external url" as like as:
>psql "postgresql://chatbot_db_z3f8_user:IkQGqICGvFKHIhNHS0aikxM4wr9JDhOW@dpg-d0ud97mmcj7s739inqrg-a.frankfurt-postgres.render.com:5432/chatbot_db_z3f8"
then gives you:\
chatbot_db_z3f8=>
now you have connected to postgresql database and lets check som commands in the db:
1- Run this to see all the tables:
chatbot_db_z3f8=>\dt


2- To list all schemas (if you're expecting more organization):
chatbot_db_z3f8=>\dn


3- And for listing all databases (though you likely only have one on Render):
chatbot_db_z3f8=> \l

4- View Table Structure
If you want to peek inside a specific table:
\d your_table_name like chatbot_db_z3f8=> \d chats;

5- select from your table: 
chatbot_db_z3f8=>SELECT * FROM chats LIMIT 10;
6- List All Tables
Run:
\dt *.*


This will show all tables in all schemas, not just the default public one.

7- Check Your Current Schema
Run:
chatbot_db_z3f8=> SHOW search_path;


8 - Or, now that you know you’re working inside the public schema, you can make things simpler by setting your search path:
SET search_path TO public;


Then you can just run:
\d chats
